#First, you'll need to set your working directory to point to the folder where your pdfs are. 
#You can do this by clicking "session" at the top of the screen, then "set working directory" then "choose directory...". 
#Your output file will write into the working directory folder. 

#You'll need to first install the package qpdf using the code below. 
install.packages("qpdf")

#Then, run the following code, changing the pdf file names to your files. You can change the output file name as well, but you don't have to. 
qpdf::pdf_combine(input = c("file2.pdf", "file2.pdf", "file3.pdf"),
                  output = "output.pdf")
